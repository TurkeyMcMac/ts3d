This  game  is a  first-person  shooter.
The  objective is  to  kill the  enemies
and  unlock the  successive levels.  The
bullets travel  pretty slowly.  Since it
is played on a  terminal which might not
have mouse support, the controls are not
usual. I can't say this is a great game,
but it is an achievement for me.
