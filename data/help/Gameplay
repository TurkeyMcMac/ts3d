Kill  the   enemies  before   they  kill
you.  Luckily, they  aren't very  smart.
They  will  turn  toward you  at  random
intervals. Some enemies do melee damage.
Other  also  shoot at  different  random
intervals.  They  may  happen  to  shoot
many bullets  in quick  succession. Each
bullet  will  do significant  damage  to
your health,  shown by the green  bar at
the bottom of the  screen. Your level of
reloadedness  is  the  red  bar  at  the
bottom. When it fills  up, you can shoot
them  back.  You  can also  shoot  their
bullets  to intercept  them, if  you aim
well.  Keep  in  mind that  the  bullets
travel slowly. The speed of your bullets
is  also  not  affected by  your  speed,
which I think  makes things easier. When
your bullet hits an  enemy, you may hear
a noise as feedback.

As you kill the enemies you need to kill
to finish the  level, the "TARGETS LEFT"
at the top left  will decrease. When you
kill everything,  you will be  told that
you have completed the level.

If you see a green arrow facing up, that
is  a  health  boost.  By  running  into
it, you  can regain some  health. Health
boosts only appear once.

The game varies  in difficulty depending
on  screen  size.  A  larger  screen  is
easier  to play  with.  A larger  screen
also  lags more  on slow  terminals. The
game is playable, though more difficult,
on the standard 80x24 terminal.
