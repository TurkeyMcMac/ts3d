Before  playing  any  levels,  you  must
create a  save. To  do so, go  to Manage
Games then  New Game. Type  your desired
name  and  press  ENTER.  You  are  then
playing  under that  name. To  play each
level,  you  must   have  completed  the
level before (the  first level is always
available.)  When  you  play  again,  go
to  Manage   Games  then   Resume  Game.
Press ENTER  with the desired  save name
selected  to resume  progressing through
the levels as you were before.
