To  play  a  level, you  must  have  won
the  level   before  it   (ignoring  the
first, always available  level.) To save
progress between games,  you must choose
a save.  To create a save,  go to Manage
Games then  New Game. Type  your desired
name  and  press  ENTER.  You  are  then
playing under  that name. When  you play
again,  go to  Manage Games  then Resume
Game. Press ENTER  with the desired save
name  selected   to  resume  progressing
through the levels as you were before.
