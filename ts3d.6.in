.SH NAME
\fBts3d\fR - Run Thing Shooter 3D


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBts3d\fR [\fIoptions\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBts3d\fR runs the game Thing Shooter 3D. This a manual for the command, not
the game. That information is available in the in-game menu.

.SS Filesystem Overrides
\fBts3d\fR uses game state, game data, and logs, all located in certain places
in the filesystem. The locations can be set by options. If the options are not
present, the locations may be set by environment variables. If the environment
variables are not present, \fBts3d\fR has defaults:
.IP \(bu 2
Game state defaults to "state.json" in the game's root directory.
.IP \(bu
Game data defaults to "data/" in the game's root directory.
.IP \(bu
By default, everything is logged to "log" in the game's root directory.
.P
These base defaults may be altered for versions of \fBts3d\fR installed as part
of some software package from a package manager.


.SH OPTIONS

.IP "\fB-d\fR \fIdata_dir\fR"
Read game data from \fIdata_dir\fR.

.IP \fB-h\fR
Print this help information and exit.

.IP "\fB-l\fR \fIlevel\fR=\fIdest\fR"
Log messages of the given \fIlevel\fR (one of "all", "info", "warning", or
"error") to the file \fIdest\fR. If the file name's empty, messages are printed
to stderr. This overrides $TS3D_LOG, where everything is sent by default.

.IP "\fB-L\fR \fIlevel\fR"
Do not log messages of the given \fIlevel\fR anywhere.

.IP "\fB-s\fR \fIstate_file\fR"
Read persistent state from \fIstate_file\fR, overriding $TS3D_STATE.

.IP \fB-v\fR
Print version information and exit.

.SH EXIT STATUS

\fBts3d\fR exits with 0 on success or a non-zero value on any failure.


.SH ENVIRONMENT

.IP HOME
If $TS3D_ROOT is not set, the game root directory is $HOME/.ts3d.

.IP TS3D_ROOT
This overrides the default root directory.

.IP TS3D_DATA
This overrides the default game data root directory.

.IP TS3D_STATE
This overrides the default game state file.

.IP TS3D_LOG
This overrides the default log file of the most recent game, including all log
levels "info", "warning", and "error".

.IP "LINES, COLUMNS"
If these variables are read by the Curses implementation, they can be used to
keep the entire screen from being drawn upon.


.SH BUGS

\fBts3d\fR at the moment does not work with unicode because Curses does not
support doing so.

The main performance bottleneck is Curses. To run the game on a large screen, a
fast terminal emulator may be needed. The hardware text mode will probably work.
GPU-accelerated terminals are the best. However, the game is playable on the
classic 80x24 screen, which almost all terminal programs can support. If you
want a large screen, test out different sizes to see how large you can get
without slowing the game.
