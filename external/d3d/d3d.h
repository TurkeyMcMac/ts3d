/* COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS
 * --------------------
 *  - D3D_PIXEL_TYPE: Pixels can be any integer type you want, but you MUST
 *    compile both your code and this library with the same D3D_PIXEL_TYPE. The
 *    types from stdint.h are not automatically available. Pixels are
 *    unsigned char by default.
 *  - D3D_UNINITIALIZED_ALLOCATOR: Don't automatically initialize d3d_malloc,
 *    d3d_realloc, and d3d_realloc to the standard library equivalents. If this
 *    symbol is defined, the library user must set the variables themselves
 *    before calling other functions. You NEED NOT compile the client code as
 *    well with this option, although you may need to change your client code
 *    depending on whether this option is set.
 *  - D3D_USE_INTERNAL_STRUCTS: Define this to have access to unstable internal
 *    structure layouts of opaque types used by the library. You NEED NOT
 *    compile d3d.c and your code with the same setting of this option.
 *  - D3D_HEADER_INCLUDE: If this is defined, instead of '#include "d3d.h"',
 *    d3d.c will use '#include D3D_HEADER_INCLUDE'. This is ONLY useful when
 *    compiling d3d.c, not the client code. */
