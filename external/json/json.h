/* FUNCTIONS
 * The followning functions manage the lifecycle of a json_reader. Unless
 * otherwise specified, no pointer parameter can be NULL.
 *
 * INITIALIZATION
 * Initialization is broken into two functions:
 *  1. json_alloc (example: json_alloc(&reader, 8, NULL, malloc, free, realloc))
 *  2. json_source
 *     (example: json_source(&reader, buf, sizeof(buf), file, my_refill_file))
 *   - json_source_string is a more specialized version
 *     (example: json_source_string(&reader, "[1,2,true]", 10))
 *   - json_source_file is for reading stdio files
 *     (example: json_source_file(&reader, buf, sizeof(buf), file))
 *  3. json_get_buf might be called at some point.
 * One function of each type should be called in that order.
 * See below for details.
 *
 * PARSING
 * The only function is json_read_item(&reader, &result), but this is the heart
 * of the library.
 *
 * DEALLOCATION
 * The only function is the simple json_free(&reader). */


/* Set the allocation routines for a parser.
 * PARAMETERS:
 *  1. reader: The parser to modify.
 *  2. stack: a memory buffer of size stacksiz, compatible with the dealloc and
 *            resize routines, or NULL if one should be generated using alloc.
 *  3. stacksiz: the initial size of the internal stack.
 *  4. alloc: The allocation function, compatible with malloc. Allocation always
 *            fails when this is NULL.
 *  5. dealloc: The deallocation function, compatible with free. When this is
 *              NULL, deallocation does nothing.
 *  6. resize: The reallocation function, compatible with realloc. Reallocation
 *             always fails when this is NULL.
 * RETURN VALUE: 0 on success, or -1 if the given allocation function failed to
 * allocate the stack of size stacksiz. */

/* Set the input source for a parser.
 * PARAMETERS:
 *  1. reader: The parser to modify.
 *  2. buf: The initial data buffer (this can be NULL.) This will be refilled
 *          before it is ever read.
 *  3. bufsiz: The initial size of the data buffer.
 *  4. ctx: The context passed to the refilling function each call (this can be
 *          NULL.)
 *  5. refill: The function used to refill a data buffer. This is mainly geared
 *             reading files. If this is NULL, then input is effectively empty.
 *         PARAMETERS:
 *          1. buf: the pointer to the internal pointer to the buffer. This will
 *                  never be NULL, but if the pointed-to value is NULL, then a
 *                  new buffer should be allocated using the given allocation
 *                  routine beforehand, perhaps with the size pointed to in
 *                  bufsiz. The function is free to change the buffer pointer.
 *                  The buffer must be filled with UTF-8.
 *          2. bufsiz: The pointer to the size of the buffer. This is the size
 *                     of the buffer, and its value can be changed.
 *          3. ctx: The pointer which was passed to json_source.
 *         RETURN VALUE: A negative number less than 256 indicates an error,
 *         which will be reported when the current call to json_read_item
 *         returns. A positive number indicates that the source still has more
 *         to give beyond the data which was just read. Zero means that the
