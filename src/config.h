// The number of ticks a turn lasts, triggered by a single key press. This is to
// smooth out key detection speeds for different terminals, as some wait longer
// before registering another press.

// The width:height ratio of each pixel. Curses seems not to have a way to
// determine this dynamically. The information is used when deciding camera
// dimensions.

// The field of view side-to-side, in radians, of a camera. The field is smaller
