.SH NAME
\fBts3d\fR - Run Thing Shooter 3D


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBts3d\fR [\fIoptions\fR] [--] [\fIplay_as\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBts3d\fR runs the game Thing Shooter 3D. This a manual for the command, not
the game. That information is available in the in-game menu.

The optional argument \fIplay_as\fR gives the name of the save to start off
with. If it does not exist, it will be created. If it is not given, you start
out anonymous; log in \fIbefore\fR playing to save your progress!


.SH OPTIONS

.IP "\fB-d\fR \fIdata_dir\fR"
Read game data from \fIdata_dir\fR.

.IP \fB-h\fR
Print this help information and exit.

.IP "\fB-l\fR \fIlevel\fR=\fIdest\fR"
Log messages of the given \fIlevel\fR (one of "all", "info", "warning", or
"error") to the file \fIdest\fR. If the file name's empty, messages are printed
to stderr. This overrides $TS3D_LOG, where everything is sent by default.

.IP "\fB-L\fR \fIlevel\fR"
Do not log messages of the given \fIlevel\fR anywhere.

.IP "\fB-s\fR \fIstate_file\fR"
Read persistent state from \fIstate_file\fR, overriding $TS3D_STATE.

.IP \fB-v\fR
Print version information and exit.

.SH EXIT STATUS

\fBts3d\fR exits with 0 on success or a non-zero value on any failure.


.SH ENVIRONMENT

.IP HOME
If $TS3D_ROOT is not set, the game root directory is $HOME/.ts3d.

.IP TS3D_ROOT
This overrides the default $HOME/.ts3d root.

.IP TS3D_DATA
This overrides the default $TS3D_ROOT/data game data root directory.

.IP TS3D_STATE
This overrides the default $TS3D_ROOT/state.json game state file.

.IP TS3D_LOG
This overrides the default $TS3D_ROOT/log log file of the most recent game,
including all log levels "info", "warning", and "error".

.IP "LINES, COLUMNS"
If these variables are read by the Curses implementation, they can be used to
keep the entire screen from being drawn upon.


.SH BUGS

\fBts3d\fR at the moment does not work with unicode because Curses does not
support doing so.

The main performance bottleneck is Curses. To run the game on a large screen, a
fast terminal emulator may be needed. The hardware text mode will probably work.
GPU-accelerated terminals are the best. However, the game is playable on the
classic 80x24 screen, which almost all terminal programs can support. If you
want a large screen, test out different sizes to see how large you can get
without slowing the game.
